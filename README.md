# Calculator Program

Welcome to the Calculator Program. This simple Java application allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Follow the guidelines below to get started.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. **IDE**: This project was developed using Visual Studio Code, but you can use any IDE that supports Java.

## Folder Structure

The project contains the following folders:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the calculator program.
- `lib`: Contains any dependencies that the project might need. Currently, this project does not have external dependencies.
- `bin`: This folder will be generated when you compile the Java files and will contain the bytecode.

> If you wish to customize the folder structure, you can modify the `.vscode/settings.json` file accordingly.

## Running the Program

1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac Calculator.java`
3. Run the program using the command: `java Calculator`

You should now see the calculator's user interface in your terminal. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
